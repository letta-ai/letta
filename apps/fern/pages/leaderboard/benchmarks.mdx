## Understanding the Letta Memory Benchmark

We measure two foundational aspects of context management: **core memory** and **archival memory**. Core memory is what is inside the agent’s [context window](https://www.letta.com/blog/memory-blocks) (aka "in-context memory") and archival memory is managing context external to the agent (aka "out-of-context memory", or "external memory").

For core memory, we measure the model's capability of both reading and writing from it. Good models should be able to utilize their core (in-context) memory to adapt their outputs and actions. For archival memory, we measure how well a model can retrieve relevant information - good models should understand when to access external information, and should be able to successfully execute one or more retrieval queries.

For all the tasks in Letta Memory Benchmark, we generate a fictional question-answering dataset with supporting facts to minimize prior knowledge from LLM training. To evaluate, we use a prompted GPT-4o to grade the agent-generated answer and the ground-truth answer, following [SimpleQA](https://openai.com/index/introducing-simpleqa/). We add a penalty for extraneous memory operations to penalize models for inefficient or incorrect archival memory accesses.

### Main Results and Recommendations

For the **closed** model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google):
* Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7, and OpenAI GPT 4.1 are recommended models for most tasks
* Normalized for cost, Gemini 2.5 Flash is a top choice
* Models that perform well on the archival memory task (e.g. Claude Haiku 3.5) might overuse memory operations when unnecessary, thus receiving a lower score on core memory due to the extraneous access penalty.
* The o-series reasoner models from OpenAI perform worse than GPT 4.1

For the **open weights** models (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek):
* Llama 3.1 405B is the best performing (overall)
* Llama 4 Scout 17B and Qwen 2.5 72B perform similarly to GPT 4.1 Mini
