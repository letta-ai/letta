<Note>
The Letta Leaderboards are [open source](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-leaderboard) and we actively encourage contributions! To learn how to add additional results or benchmarking tasks, read our [contributor guide](/leaderboard/contributing).

The Letta Leaderboards help developers select which language models to use in the Letta framework by reporting the performance of popular models on a series of tasks.

Letta is designed for building [stateful agents](/guides/agents/overview) - agents that are long-running and can automatically manage long-term memory to learn and adapt over time.
To implement intelligent memory management, agents in Letta rely heavily on **tool (function) calling**, so models that excel at tool use tend to do well in Letta. Conversely, models that struggle to call tools properly often perform poorly when used to drive Letta agents.


## Letta Memory Leaderboard

The memory benchmark tests the ability of a model to understand a memory hierarchy and manage its own memory. Models that are strong at function calling and aware of their limitations (understanding in-context vs out-of-context data) typically excel here.

**Overall Score** refers to the combined core memory + archival memory score. **Cost** refers to (approximate) cost in USD to run the benchmark. Open weights models prefixed with `together` were run on [Together's API](/guides/server/providers/together).
You can read more about how the memory benchmark is constructed [here](/leaderboard/benchmarks).
