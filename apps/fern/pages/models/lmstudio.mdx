<Warning>
LM Studio support is currently experimental. If things aren't working as expected, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/letta)!
</Warning>

<Tip>
Models marked as ["native tool use"](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/advanced/tool-use#supported-models) on LM Studio are more likely to work well with Letta.
</Tip>

## Setup LM Studio

1. Download + install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and the model you want to test with
2. Make sure to start the [LM Studio server](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/api/server)

## Enabling LM Studio as a provider
To enable the LM Studio provider, you must set the `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL` environment variable. When this is set, Letta will use available LLM and embedding models running on LM Studio.

### Using the `docker run` server with LM Studio
Since LM Studio is running on the host network, you will need to use `host.docker.internal` to connect to the LM Studio server instead of `localhost`.
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL="http://host.docker.internal:1234" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

### Using `letta run` and `letta server` with LM Studio
To chat with an agent, run:
```bash
export LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1234"
letta run
```
To run the Letta server, run:
```bash
export LMSTIUDIO_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1234"
letta server
```
To select the model used by the server, use the dropdown in the ADE or specify a `LLMConfig` object in the Python SDK.
