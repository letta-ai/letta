title: Define and customize tools

<Tip>
Letta has a native integration with [Composio](/guides/agents/composio), which supports over 7000 pre-made tools to connect with popular services such as Slack, GitHub, Discord, etc.
You can also create your own custom tools from scratch using Python.

## Default Letta Tools
By default, agents in Letta are created with the following tools:

| Tool                       | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `send_message`             | Sends a message to the human user.                   |
| `conversation_search`      | Search prior conversation history                    |
| `archival_memory_insert`   | Add a memory to archival memory                      |
| `archival_memory_search`   | Search archival memory via embedding search          |


## Custom Tools
You can create custom tools in Letta in Python. When you define the function for the tool, you must make sure to have a properly formatting docstring for Letta to parse the function schema.
```python
from letta import Letta

client = Letta(token="LETTA_API_KEY")

# define a function with a docstring
def roll_dice() -> str:
    """
    Simulate the roll of a 20-sided die (d20).

    This function generates a random integer between 1 and 20, inclusive,
    which represents the outcome of a single roll of a d20.

    Returns:
        str: The result of the die roll.
    """
    import random

    dice_role_outcome = random.randint(1, 20)
    output_string = f"You rolled a {dice_role_outcome}"
    return output_string


# create the tool
tool = client.tools.create_from_function(
    func=roll_dice
)
print(f"Created tool {tool.name}")
```

### Adding tools to agents in the Python SDK
Once the tool is created, you can add it to an agent by passing the tool name to the `tools` parameter in the agent creation.
```python
# create a new agent
agent = client.agents.create(
    memory_blocks=[
        {"label": "human", "limit": 2000, "value": "Name: Bob"},
        {"label": "persona", "limit": 2000, "value": "You are a friendly agent"}
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-ada-002",
    tool_ids=[tool.id]
)
```

## Tool Environment Variables
You can set agent-scoped environment variables for your tools.
These environment variables will be accessible in the sandboxed environment that any of the agent tools are run in.

For example, if you define a custom tool that requires an API key to run (e.g. `EXAMPLE_TOOL_API_KEY`), you can set the variable at time of agent creation by using the `tool_exec_environment_variables` parameter:
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8283/v1/agents/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "llm":"openai/gpt-4",
  "embedding":"openai/text-embedding-ada-002",
  "tool_exec_environment_variables": {
      "EXAMPLE_TOOL_API_KEY": "banana"
    },
  "memory_blocks": []
}'
```

## External Tool Libraries
Letta also has early support for adding tools from the external tool library [Composio](https://docs.composio.dev).
This integrations works by converting the external library tools into Letta tools.

For more information on setting up Composio tools, see our [Composio guide](/guides/agents/composio).

## Excluding Default Tools
To skip adding default tools when creating a new agent, you can add in `include_default_tools=False` to the agent creation:
```python
# create an agent with no tools
agent = client.agents.create(
    include_default_tools=False
)
```
Warning: this will create an agent with no tools, so the agent will have no ability to manage memory or search conversation history.



## Tool Rules
Tool rules allow you to define graph-like constrains on your tools, such as requiring that a tool terminate agent execution or be followed by another tool.
