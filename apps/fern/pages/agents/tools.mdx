Tools allow agents to take actions by executing Python code. Letta uses tools to manage memory and even to send messages to the end user. You can add custom tools to Letta by defining your own tools, and also customize the execution environment of the tools. You can import external tool libraries like Composio.

# Default Tools
By default, agents in Letta are created with the following tools:

| Tool                       | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `send_message`             | Sends a message to the human user.                   |
| `core_memory_append`       | Append to the contents of a block in core memory.    |
| `core_memory_replace`      | Replace the contents of a block in core memory.      |
| `conversation_search`      | Search prior conversation history (recall memory)    |
| `archival_memory_insert`   | Add a memory to archival memory                      |
| `archival_memory_search`   | Search archival memory via embedding search          |

Letta also includes a set of pre-made tools designed for multi-agent interaction.
See [our guide on multi-agent](/guides/agents/multi-agent) for more information.

You can disable the default tools by passing `include_base_tools=False` to the agent creation.

# Defining Custom Tools
You can create custom tools in Letta using the SDKs, as well as via the [ADE tool builder](/guides/ade/usage#tools). See more on defining custom tools [here](/guides/agents/custom-tools).

Once the tool is created, you can add it to an agent by passing the tool name to the `tools` parameter in the agent creation.
```python title="python" {9}
# create a new agent
agent = client.agents.create(
    memory_blocks=[
        {"label": "human", "limit": 2000, "value": "Name: Bob"},
        {"label": "persona", "limit": 2000, "value": "You are a friendly agent"}
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    tools=["my_custom_tool_name"]
)
```

# Tool Execution
You can custom the enviornment that your tool runs in (the Python package dependencies and environment variables) by setting a tool execution environment. See more [here](/guides/agents/tool-execution).

# Tool Environment Variables
You can set agent-scoped environment variables for your tools.
These environment variables will be accessible in the sandboxed environment that any of the agent tools are run in.

For example, if you define a custom tool that requires an API key to run (e.g. `EXAMPLE_TOOL_API_KEY`), you can set the variable at time of agent creation by using the `tool_exec_environment_variables` parameter:
```python title="python" {9-11}
# create an agent with no tools
agent = client.agents.create(
    memory_blocks=[
        {"label": "human", "limit": 2000, "value": "Name: Bob"},
        {"label": "persona", "limit": 2000, "value": "You are a friendly agent"}
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    tool_exec_environment_variables={
        "EXAMPLE_TOOL_API_KEY": "banana"
    }
)
```
# Tool Rules
Tool rules allow you to define graph-like constrains on your tools, such as requiring that a tool terminate agent execution or be followed by another tool.

Read more about tool rules [here](/guides/agents/tool-rules).

# External Tool Libraries
Letta also has early support for adding tools from external tool libraries via MCP and Composio.

For more information on setting up **MCP servers**, see our [MCP guide](/guides/agents/mcp).

For more information on setting up **Composio tools**, see our [Composio guide](/guides/agents/composio).
