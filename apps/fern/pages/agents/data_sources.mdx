Data sources allow you to load files into an agent's archival memory. Agents' archival memory is a set of `Passage` objects, which consist of a chunk of `text` and a corresponding `embedding`. Data sources consist of a group of `Passage` objects which can be copied into an agent's archival memory.

# Creating a data source
To create a data source, you will need to specify a unique `name` as well as an `EmbeddingConfig`:
```python
# get an available embedding_config
embedding_configs = client.models.list_embedding_models()
embedding_config = embedding_configs[0]

# create the source
source = client.sources.create(
    name="my_source", 
    embedding_config=embedding_config
)
```
Now that you've created the source, you can start loading data into the source. 

## Uploading a file into a data source
Uploading a file to a source will create an async job for processing the file, which will split the file into chunks and embed them. 
```python
# upload a file into the source
job = client.sources.files.upload(
    source_id=source.id, 
    file=open("my_file.txt", "rb")
)
# wait until the job is completed
while True:
    job = client.jobs.retrieve(job.id)
    if job.status == "completed":
        break
    elif job.status == "failed":
        raise ValueError(f"Job failed: {job.metadata}")
    print(f"Job status: {job.status}")
    time.sleep(1)
```
Once the job is completed, you can list the files and the generated passages in the source: 
```python
# list files in the source
files = client.sources.files.list(source_id=source.id)
print(f"Files in source: {files}")

# list passages in the source
passages = client.sources.passages.list(source_id=source.id)
print(f"Passages in source: {passages}")
```

## Listing available data sources 
You can view available data sources by listing them: 
```python
# list sources
sources = client.sources.list()
```

# Connecting a data source to an agent
When you attach a data source to an agent, the passages in that data source will be copied into the agent's archival memory. Note that if you load new data into your data source, it will *not* be copied into the agent's archival memory unless you re-attach the data sources (detach then attach it again)

## Attaching the data source 
You can attach a source to an agent by specifying both the source and agent IDs: 
```python
client.agents.sources.attach(agent_id=agent.id, source_id=source.id)
```
Note that your agent and source must be configured with the same embedding model, to ensure that the agent is able to search accross a common embedding space for archival memory. 

## Detaching the data source
Detaching a data source will remove the passages in an agent's archival memory that was loaded from that source: 
```python
client.agents.sources.detach(agent_id=agent.id, source_id=source.id)
```
