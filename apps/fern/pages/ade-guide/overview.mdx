title: Agent Developmenet Environment (ADE)

<Tip>
The cloud/web ADE is avilable at [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com), and can connect to your Letta server running on `localhost`, as well as self-hosted deployments.

If you would like to run Letta completely locally (both the server and ADE), you can also use [Letta Desktop](/quickstart/desktop) instead (currently in alpha).

The ADE is an integrated development environment which allows you to create, edit, interact with and monitor Letta agents.
You can use the ADE to chat with agents you've already created, or to design new agents from scratch - editing their memory state, data sources, and even customizing their tools all from within the ADE.

## Main ADE features
You can use the ADE to create, edit, and test agents running inside a Letta Server.
The ADE provides you direct visibility into your agent's state, including its context window, core memory blocks, attached tools, and archival memory (e.g. vector database).

### üëæ Agent Simulator
The **agent simulator** (*center panel*) provides a real-time view of your agent's conversation and event history.
Beyond just chatting, you can send system messages (e.g. for meta/event style messages) and observe how your agent processes information and makes decisions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Agent Configuration
Use the ADE to configure your **agent's settings** (*left panel*):
- Choose from different LLM models
- Configure your agent's system instructions
- Connect tools and data sources to your agent

### üß† State Visualization
Monitor your **agent's state** in real-time (*right panel*):
- **Context window viewer** shows exactly what information your agent is currently processing
- **Core memory blocks** display persistent agent knowledge
- **Archival memory** connects your agent to external data sources
