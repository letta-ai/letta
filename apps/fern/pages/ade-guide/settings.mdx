You can change your agent name and system instructions in the "Agent Settings" panel.
The agent ID is shown below the agent name, and is what you use to identify your agent when interacting with it via the [Letta APIs / SDKs](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference).

### Changing the LLM model
You can change the LLM model of your agent to any model registered on the Letta server.
To enable more models on your Letta server, follow the Letta server [model configuration instructions](/models).

### Changing the embedding model
<Warning>We do not recommend changing the embedding model of your agent frequently. If you already have existing data in archival memory, those memories will have to be re-embedded if you change your embedding model backend.</Warning>
You can also change the embedding model of your agent under "Advanced" agent settings.
