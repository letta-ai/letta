Data sources allow you to connect large datasets or file uploads to your agent. To connect your agent to a data source:
1. Create a new data source (or select an existing one), for example *Business Guidelines*
2. If you created a new data source, upload your data to the data source (for example, the PDF files related to your business guidelines).
3. Attach the data source to the agent

The agent will now be able to view data in the data source via its `archival_memory_search` tool. You can detach a data source from an agent at any time.
