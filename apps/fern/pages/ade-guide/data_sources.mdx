Data sources provide a powerful way to enrich your agent with external knowledge, documentation, or specialized information without manually adding it to memory. This feature allows your agent to access and reference large collections of content seamlessly.

## What Are Data Sources?

Data sources are collections of documents or information that:

- Exist independently from any specific agent
- Can be attached to or detached from agents as needed
- Are automatically processed and made searchable
- Serve as knowledge bases for your agents to reference

Common examples include company documentation, product manuals, research papers, knowledge articles, and curated datasets.

## Managing Data Sources in the ADE

### Creating and Populating Data Sources

To connect your agent to a data source:

1. **Create a new data source** (or select an existing one), e.g., *Business Guidelines*
2. **Upload your content** to the data source in supported formats:
   - PDF documents
   - Text files (.txt)
   - Markdown files (.md)
   - Word documents (.docx)
   - HTML files
3. **Attach the data source** to your agent through the Data Sources panel

### How Agents Access Data Sources

When a data source is attached to an agent:

- The data is automatically processed and embedded in the vector database
- The agent can retrieve information using the standard `archival_memory_search` tool
- Results from data sources are labeled with their source for better attribution
- You can detach a data source at any time if the information is no longer relevant

## Viewing Connected Data Sources

The Data Sources panel in the ADE shows:

- All data sources currently connected to your agent
- The option to attach new data sources
- The ability to detach sources that are no longer needed
- Information about the content within each data source

This visibility helps you manage what external knowledge your agent can access during conversations.
