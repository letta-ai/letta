## Adding LLM backends
The Letta server can be connected to various LLM API backends.
You can add additional LLM API backends by opening the integrations panel (clicking the <Icon icon="square-rss" /> icon).
When you configure a new integration (by setting the environment variable in the dialog), the Letta Server will be restarted to load the new LLM API backend.

You can also edit the environment variable file directly, located at `~/.letta/env`.

For this quickstart demo, we'll add an OpenAI API key (once we enter our key and **click confirm**, the Letta Server will automatically restart):

## Alpha Status

Letta Desktop is currently in **alpha**. View known issues and FAQ [here](/guides/desktop/troubleshooting).

For a more stable development experience, we recommend installing Letta via Docker.
