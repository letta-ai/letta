Letta uses [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/) to store telemetry. Clickhouse is a database optimized for storing logs and traces. Traces can be used to view raw requests to LLM providers and also understand your agent's system performance metrics. 

## Configuring Clickhouse
You will need to have a Clickhouse DB (either running locally or with [Clickhouse Cloud](https://console.clickhouse.cloud/)) to connect to Letta. 

You can configure Clickhouse by passing the required enviornment variables: 
```sh
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  ...
  -e CLICKHOUSE_ENDPOINT=${CLICKHOUSE_ENDPOINT} \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE=${CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE} \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME=${CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME} \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=${CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD} \
  letta/letta:latest
```

### Finding your credentials in Clickhouse Cloud
You can find these variable inside of Clickhouse Cloud by selecting the "Connection" button in the dashboard.

## Connecting to Grafana 
We recommend connecting Clickhouse to Grafana to query and view traces.
