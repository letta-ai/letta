title: Collecting Traces & Telemetry
slug: guides/server/otel
---

Letta uses [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) to store telemetry. ClickHouse is a database optimized for storing logs and traces. Traces can be used to view raw requests to LLM providers and also understand your agent's system performance metrics.

## Configuring ClickHouse
You will need to have a ClickHouse DB (either running locally or with [ClickHouse Cloud](https://console.clickhouse.cloud/)) to connect to Letta.

You can configure ClickHouse by passing the required enviornment variables:
```sh
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  ...
  -e CLICKHOUSE_ENDPOINT=${CLICKHOUSE_ENDPOINT} \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE=${CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE} \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME=${CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME} \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=${CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD} \
  letta/letta:latest
```

### Finding your credentials in ClickHouse Cloud
You can find these variable inside of ClickHouse Cloud by selecting the "Connection" button in the dashboard.

## Connecting to Grafana
We recommend connecting ClickHouse to Grafana to query and view traces. Grafana can be run [locally](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/), or via [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/grafana/).
