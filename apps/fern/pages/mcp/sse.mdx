title: Connecting Letta to a SSE MCP Server
slug: guides/mcp/sse
---

<Warning>
Many remote MCP servers use unauthenticated URLs (meaning that anyone with the URL is able to use the tools on the MCP server), **so make sure you keep your MCP server URLs private**.
</Warning>

Connecting to a remote MCP server is as simple as adding the URL to your `~/.letta/mcp_config.json` file.
For example, if you have the URL of an MCP server that looks like `https://mcp-server-123456.externaldomain.com`, simply add it to your `~/.letta/mcp_config.json` file like so:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myRemoteServerName": {
      "url": "https://mcp-server-123456.externaldomain.com"
    }
  }
}
```

To add more servers, simply add more entries to the config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myRemoteServerName": {
      "url": "https://mcp-server-123456.externaldomain.com"
    },
    "myRemoteServerName2": {
      "url": "https://mcp-server-78910.externaldomain.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: connecting to the Everything MCP server

The "Everything MCP server" ([repo link](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/everything)) is an example server made by Anthropic intended to showcase the full featureset of the MCP protocol.

The source code for the server includes the option to run it in SSE mode, so we can use it as an example for how to connect Letta to a locally running SSE server.

<Accordion title="Step 1: Install the Everything MCP server">
If you don't have npm installed, [install it here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Then follow these steps:
```bash
# First clone the GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd servers/src/everything

# Install with npm
npm install
npm run build
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Launch the MCP server in SSE mode">
In the same directory, run `npm run` (make sure to specify SSE mode with `:sse`):
```bash
npm run start:sse
```

Once started, you'll see this output in your terminal:
```
> @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything@0.6.2 start:sse
> node dist/sse.js

Server is running on port 3001
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Modify your `~/.letta/mcp_config.json` file">
By default, the Everything MCP server will run on port `3001`. It will listen for SSE connections on `:3001/SSE`, so that's the address we'll use.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everything": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

If we're using Docker, we'll need to modify the address to be `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everything": {
        "url": "http://host.docker.internal:3001/sse"
    }
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Launch the MCP server in SSE mode">
In this example, we'll use Docker to show you how to read your `~/.letta/mcp_config.json` file.

To mount your `~/.letta/mcp_config.json` file into Docker, when we run `docker run` we need to add `-v ~/.letta/mcp_config.json:/root/.letta/mcp_config.json`:
```bash
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -v ~/.letta/mcp_config.json:/root/.letta/mcp_config.json \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  letta/letta:latest
```

## Attaching an MCP tool to an agent

Once your Letta server has ingested your `~/.letta/mcp_config.json` file and registered the tools, you still need to attach your tools to your agent (if your `mcp_config.json` was set up correctly, then the tools will now be available to attach).

This can be done via the ADE (by opening the tool browser), or programatically via the API / SDKs.
