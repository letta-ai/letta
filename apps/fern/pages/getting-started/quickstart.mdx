subtitle: Create your first Letta agent with the API and view it in the ADE
slug: quickstart
---

The Letta API provides a simple interface to creating stateful AI agents with advanced memory that can take reason, execute complex sequences of actions, and learn from experience.

## Initial setup

To start building on Letta, you'll either need a **Letta Cloud API key**, or you'll need to run your own **Letta server**.

- **Letta Cloud**: Letta Cloud is currently in early access (request access [here](https://forms.letta.com/early-access)). If you have access, you can retrieve an API key on [your account dashboard](/guides/cloud/letta-api-key).
- **Self-hosted**: There are a few options to run Letta locally: via [Docker](/guides/selfhosting), [pip](/guides/selfhosting), and [Letta Desktop](/guides/desktop/install). We recommend Docker for must users, or Letta Desktop for users that want to run the ADE (UI) locally.

## Create an agent

This example creates an agent with two self-editing memory blocks (one for storing information about the user, and one for storing information about the agent itself).

<Info>
If you're self-hosting Letta, set the base URL to the address of your Letta server (defaults to `http://localhost:8283`).
When self-hosting, `token` is not required unless using [passwords]().
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```python title="python" maxLines=50
# install letta_client with `pip install letta-client`
from letta_client import Letta

# for Letta Cloud
client = Letta(token="LETTA_API_KEY")

# for self-hosted
client = Letta(base_url="http://localhost:8283")

agent_state = client.agents.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    memory_blocks=[
        {
          "label": "human",
          "value": "The human's name is Chad. They like vibe coding."
        },
        {
          "label": "persona",
          "value": "My name is Sam, the all-knowing sentient AI."
        }
    ]
)

print(agent_state.id)
```
```typescript maxLines=50 title="node.js"
// install letta-client with `npm install @letta-ai/letta-client`
import { LettaClient } from '@letta-ai/letta-client'

// for Letta Cloud
const client = new LettaClient({ token: "LETTA_API_KEY" });

// for self-hosted
const client = new LettaClient({ baseUrl: "http://localhost:8283" });

const agentState = await client.agents.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4.1",
    embedding: "openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    memoryBlocks: [
        {
          label: "human",
          value: "The human's name is Chad. They like vibe coding."
        },
        {
          label: "persona",
          value: "My name is Sam, the all-knowing sentient AI."
        }
    ]
});

console.log(agentState.id);
```
```curl curl
curl -X POST https://api.letta.com/v1/agents \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $LETTA_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4.1",
  "embedding": "openai/text-embedding-3-small",
  "memory_blocks": [
    {
      "label": "human",
      "value": "The human'\''s name is Chad. They like vibe coding."
    },
    {
      "label": "persona",
      "value": "My name is Sam, the all-knowing sentient AI."
    }
  ]
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Message an agent

<Note>
The Letta API supports streaming both agent *steps* and streaming *tokens*.
For more information on streaming, see [our streaming guide](/guides/agents/streaming).
</Note>

Once the agent is created, we can send the agent a message using its `id` field:
<CodeGroup>
```python title="python" maxLines=50
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent_state.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "hows it going????"
        }
    ]
)

for message in response.messages:
    print(message)
```
```typescript maxLines=50 title="node.js"
const response = await client.agents.messages.create(
    agentState.id, {
        messages: [
            {
                role: "user",
                content: "hows it going????"
            }
        ]
    }
);

for (const message of response.messages) {
    console.log(message);
}
```
```curl curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.letta.com/v1/agents/$AGENT_ID/messages \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $LETTA_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "hows it going????"
    }
  ]
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

The response contains the agent's full response to the message, which includes reasoning steps (chain-of-thought), tool calls, tool responses, and assistant (agent) messages:
```json maxLines=50
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "message-29d8d17e-7c50-4289-8d0e-2bab988aa01e",
      "date": "2024-12-12T17:05:56+00:00",
      "message_type": "reasoning_message",
      "reasoning": "User seems curious and casual. Time to engage!"
    },
    {
      "id": "message-29d8d17e-7c50-4289-8d0e-2bab988aa01e",
      "date": "2024-12-12T17:05:56+00:00",
      "message_type": "assistant_message",
      "content": "Hey there! I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How about you?"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 56,
    "prompt_tokens": 2030,
    "total_tokens": 2086,
    "step_count": 1
  }
}
```
You can read more about the response format from the message route [here](/guides/agents/overview#message-types).

## Using the ADE

We've created and messaged our first stateful agent.
This agent lives inside the Letta server (either on your self-hosted server, or on Letta Cloud), and you can use the Letta API to interact with your agent as long as the server is running.

Another way to interact with Letta agents is via the [Agent Development Environment](/guides/ade/overview) (or ADE for short). The ADE is a UI on top of the Letta API that allows you to quickly build, prototype, and observe your agents without needing to write any code.

If we navigate to our agent in the ADE, we should see our agent's state in full detail, as well as the message that we sent to it:
<img className="block w-300 dark:hidden" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letta-ai/letta/refs/heads/main/assets/example_ade_screenshot_light.png" />
<img className="hidden w-300 dark:block" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letta-ai/letta/refs/heads/main/assets/example_ade_screenshot.png" />

The main way to use the ADE is via the browser at [app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com), connects to both self-hosted Letta servers and Letta Cloud. You can also use [Letta Desktop](/guides/desktop/install) (which bundles the ADE and the Letta server into a single application) to run the ADE locally.

[Read our ADE setup guide â†’](/guides/ade/setup)

## Next steps

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You just created and messaged your first stateful agent with Letta, using both the Letta ADE, API, and Python/Typescript SDKs.

Now that you've succesfully created a basic agent with Letta, you're ready to start building more complex agents and AI applications.
