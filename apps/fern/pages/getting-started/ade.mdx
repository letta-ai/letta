## What is the ADE?
The **Agent Development Environment (ADE)** is a visual interface for creating and managing stateful agents.
Use the ADE to design, test, and monitor your agents while getting direct visibility into their memory state and decision-making process.

Unlike simple chatbot interfaces, the ADE gives you complete control over your agent's state across its entire lifecycle:
- Create and customize agents without writing code
- Visualize your agent's memory and context window in real-time
- Add and test custom tools in a sandboxed environment
- Monitor agent behavior and performance

The ADE provides a graphical interface to agents running in your Letta server.
These same agents can be accessed via the [Letta APIs](/api-reference/overview), allowing you to integrate them into your applications.

## Main ADE features
You can use the ADE to create, edit, and test agents running inside a Letta Server.
The ADE provides you direct visibility into your agent's state, including its context window, core memory blocks, attached tools, and archival memory (e.g. vector database).

### üëæ Agent Simulator
The **agent simulator** (*center panel*) provides a real-time view of your agent's conversation and event history.
Beyond just chatting, you can send system messages (e.g. for meta/event style messages) and observe how your agent processes information and makes decisions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Agent Configuration
Use the ADE to configure your **agent's settings** (*left panel*):
- Choose from different LLM models
- Configure your agent's system instructions
- Connect tools and data sources to your agent

### üß† State Visualization
Monitor your **agent's state** in real-time (*right panel*):
- **Context window viewer** shows exactly what information your agent is currently processing
- **Core memory blocks** display persistent agent knowledge
- **Archival memory** connects your agent to external data sources
