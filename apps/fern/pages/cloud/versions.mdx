title: Versioning Agent Templates
slug: guides/templates/versioning

<Note>
Versioning is a feature in [agent templates](/guides/templates) (part of [Letta Cloud](/guides/cloud)).
To use versioning, you must be using an agent template, not an agent.
</Note>

Versions allow you to keep track of the changes you've made to your template over time.
Agent templates follow the versioning convention of `template-name:version-number`.

Similar to [Docker tags](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/build-tag-and-publish-an-image/#tagging-images), you can specify the latest version of a template using the `latest` keyword (`template-name:latest`).

## Creating a new template version
When you create a template, it starts off at version 1.
Once you've make edits to your template in the ADE, you can create a new version of the template by clicking the "Template" button in the ADE (top right), then clicking "Save new template version".
Version numbers are incremented automatically (e.g. version 1 becomes version 2).

## Migrating existing agents to a new template version
If you've deployed agents on a previous version of the template, you'll be asked if you want to migrate your existing agents to the new version of the template.
When you migrate existing agents to a new template version, Letta Cloud will re-create your existing agents using the new template information, but keeping prior agent state such as the conversation history.
The memory state of the agent will be recreated from the new version of the template (memory variables will be injected using the prior agent variables).

### When should I migrate (or not migrate) my agents?
One reason you might want to migrate your agents is if you've added new tools to your agent template: migrating existing agents to the new version of the template will give them access to the new tools, while retaining all of their prior state.

If you make significant changes to the memory structure of the agent template (e.g. adding new memory blocks), you likely are better off creating a new agent template instead.
You can easily create a new agent template from an existing template by **forking** your template (click the settings button ⚙️ in the ADE, then click "Fork Template").

## Specifying a version when creating an agent

You can specify a template version when creating an agent in the [agent creation endpoint](/api-reference/agents/create).
For example, to deploy an agent from a template called `template-name` at version 2, you would use `:v2` as the template tag:
```sh
curl -X POST https://app.letta.com/v1/agents \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "from_template": template-name:v2"
  }'
```
