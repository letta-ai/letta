## Using Your Own API Keys

Connect your own API keys for supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to Letta Cloud through the [settings page](). When you have a custom API key connected for a provider, Letta Cloud will use your key for all model requests to that provider.

## Billing and Quotas

Requests made using your personal API keys do not count towards your monthly request quotas or usage-based billing. Instead, you'll be billed directly by the provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) according to their pricing for your personal account.

Note that direct provider pricing will likely differ from Letta Cloud rates, and requests through your own API key may cost more than those made through Letta Cloud's managed services.
