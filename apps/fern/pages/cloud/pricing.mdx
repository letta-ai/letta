</Note>

Letta Cloud's pricing model is designed to be simple, flexible, and predictable - allowing you to focus on building your applications on top of the powerful stateful agents running in the cloud.

## Reasoning Units
Letta Cloud offers a usage based consumption model (pay for what you use).
When you run an agent with an API call, you are charegd per agent step (when an agent runs, it takes at minimum one step).

Each agent step costs a fixed amount of Reasoning Units (RUs), conditional on the model used to power the agent.
Stronger (larger) models consume more RUs per step, while faster and smaller models use fewer RUs per step.
