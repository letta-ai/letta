## Understanding Requests

Your Letta agents use large language models (LLMs) to reason and take actions. These model requests are what we count toward your monthly quota.

### Standard vs Premium Models

**Standard models** (`GPT-4o mini`, `Gemini Flash`, etc.) are faster and more economical. They're ideal for simple tool calling and basic chat interactions.

**Premium models** (`GPT-4.1`, `Claude Sonnet`, etc.) offer enhanced capabilities for complex agentic tasks. They excel at multi-step tool sequences and tasks requiring advanced reasoning.

Some high-powered models (like `o1` and `o3`) are available exclusively through usage-based pricing.

### How Requests Are Counted

Each agent "step" or "action" counts as one model request. Complex tasks (such as [deep research](https://github.com/letta-ai/agent-file/tree/main/deep_research_agent)) may require multiple requests to complete. You can control request usage via [tool rules](/guides/agents/tool-rules) that force the agent to stop on certain conditions.

### Quota Refresh

Request quotas refresh every month.
Hobby plan quotas refresh on the 1st of each month. Pro plan quotas refresh at the start of your billing cycle. Unused requests do not roll over to the next month.

## Usage-based Pricing

If you are on the Pro plan, you can enable usage-based pricing to allow you to continue to make model requests after you've exceeded your request quota. Unused credits purchased roll over on each billing cycle.

Usage-based billing can be enabled by adding credits to your account under your [account settings](https://app.letta.com/settings/organization/billing) page. See a full model list and pricing [here](https://app.letta.com/models).

## Enterprise Plans

For organizations with higher volume needs, our Enterprise plan offers increased quotas, dedicated support, role-based access control (RBAC), SSO (SAML, OIDC), and private model deployment options.
