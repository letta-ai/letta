title: Connecting to the ADE
slug: guides/ade/setup
---
<Tip>
The ADE is currently in public beta. During the beta period, you can access the ADE at [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com) and connect it to your local Letta server or self-hosted deployments.
</Tip>

The ADE can connect to self-hosted Letta servers (e.g. a Letta server running on your laptop), as well as the Letta Cloud service.
When connected to a self-hosted / private server, the ADE uses the Letta REST API to communicate with your server.

## Connecting to a local server
To connect the ADE with your local Letta server, simply:
1. Start your Letta server (`docker run ...`)
2. Visit [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com) and you will see "Local server" as an option in the left panel

### üîê Password protection
To password protect your server, include `SECURE=true` and `LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword` in your `docker run` command:
```sh
# If LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD isn't set, the server will autogenerate a password
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  --env-file .env \
  -e SECURE=true \
  -e LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  letta/letta:latest
```

## üåê Connecting to an external (self-hosted) server
If your Letta server isn't running on `localhost` (for example, you deployed it on an external service like EC2):
1. Click "Add remote server"
2. Enter your desired server name, the IP address of the server, and the server password (if set, otherwise leave empty)
