Agent templates allow you to create a common starting point (or "template") for your agents.
You can define the structure of your agent (its tools and memory) in a template,
then easily create new agents off of that template.

Agent templates support *versioning*, which allows you to programatically 
upgrade all agents on an old version of a template to the new version of the same template.

Agent templates also support *memory variables*, a way to conveniently customize
sections of memory inside the template at time of agent creation.

## Example usecase: customer service

Imagine you're creating a customer service chatbot application.
You may want every user that starts a chat sesion to get their own personalized agent:
the agent should know things specific to each user, like their purchase history, membership status, and so on.

However, despite being custom to individual users, each agent may share a common structure:
all agents may have access to the same tools, and the general strucutre of their memory may look the same.
For example, all customer service agents may have the `update_ticket_status` tool that allows the agent to update the status of a support ticket in your backend service.
Additionally, the agents may share a common structure to their memory block storing user information.

This is the perfect scenario to use an agent template!
You can take advantage of memory variables to write our user memory to exploit common structure:
```
The user is contacting me to resolve a customer support issue.
Their name is {{name}} and the ticket number associated with this request is {{ticket}}.
They have spent ${{amount}} on the platform.
```

Notice how the memory block uses variables (wrapped in `{{ }}`) to specify what part of the memory should be defined at agent creation time, vs within the template itself.
When we create an agent using this template, we can specify the values to use in place of the variables.

## Agents vs. Agent Templates

Templates define a common starting point for your agents, but they are not agents themselves.
When you are editing a template in the ADE, the ADE will simulate an agent for you
(to help you debug and design your template), but the agent in the simulator is ephemeral (it is not retained).

To create a persistent agent from a template, you can use the "Deploy Template" API route:
```sh
curl ...
```

## Versioning

When you create a template, it starts off at version 1.
When you make edits to your template in the ADE, you'll be prompted to update the version of the template.

If you've deployed agents on a previous version of the template, you'll be asked if you want to migrate your existing agents to the new version of the template.
