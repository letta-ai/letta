The ADE can connect to self-hosted Letta servers (e.g. a Letta server running on your laptop), as well as the Letta Cloud service.
When connected to a self-hosted / private server, the ADE uses the Letta REST API to communicate with your server.

# üñ•Ô∏è Connecting to a local server
To connect the ADE with your local Letta server, simply:
1. Start your Letta server (`docker run ...`)
2. Visit [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com) and you will see "Local server" as an option in the left panel

### üîê Password protection

To password protect your server, include `SECURE=true` and `LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword` in your `docker run` command:
```sh
# If LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD isn't set, the server will autogenerate a password
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  --env-file .env \
  -e SECURE=true \
  -e LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  letta/letta:latest
```

# üåê Connecting to an external (self-hosted) server
If your Letta server isn't running on `localhost` (for example, you deployed it on an external service like EC2):
1. Click "Add remote server"
2. Enter your desired server name, the IP address of the server, and the server password (if set, otherwise leave empty)

## Example: connecting to a Letta server running on [Railway](https://railway.app/)

<Tip>Railway is a service that allows you to easily deploy services (such as Docker containers) to the cloud. The following example uses Railway, but the same general principles around deploying the Letta Docker image on a cloud service and connecting it to the ADE) are generally applicable to other cloud services beyond Railway.</Tip>

### Step 1: Deploy the Railway template

We've prepared a Letta Railway template that has the necessary environment variables set and mounts a persistent volume for database storage.
You can access the template below: [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/jgUR1t?referralCode=kdR8zc)

<Frame caption="The deployment screen will give you the opportunity to specify some basic environment variables such as your OpenAI API key. You can also specify these after deployment in the variables section in the Railway viewer.">

<Frame caption="If the deployment is successful, it will be shown as 'Active', and you can click 'View logs'.">

</Frame>

<Frame caption="Clicking 'View logs' will reveal the static IP address of the deployment (ending in 'railway.app').">

</Frame>

### Step 2: Add a new remote server to the ADE
Now that the Railway deployment is active, all we need to do is add it to the ADE as a new remote Letta server.
The default password set in the template is `password`, which can be changed at the deployment stage or afterwards in the 'variables' page on the Railway deployment.

Click "Add remote server", then enter the details from Railway (use the static IP address shown in the logs, and use the password set via the environment variables):

<Check>That's it! Now you should be able to create and interact with agents on your remote Letta server (deployed on Railway) via the ADE. üëæ ‚òÑÔ∏è</Check>
