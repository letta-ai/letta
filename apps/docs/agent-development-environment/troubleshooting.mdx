1. Install `mkcert` ([installation instructions](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))
2. Run `mkcert -install`
3. Update to Letta version `0.6.3` or greater
4. Add `LOCAL_HTTPS=true` to your Letta environment variables
5. Restart your Letta Docker container
6. Access the ADE at [https://app.letta.com/development-servers/local/dashboard](https://app.letta.com/development-servers/local/dashboard)
