<Tip>To enable Anthropic models with Letta, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment variables. </Tip>

You can use Letta with Anthropic if you have an Anthropic account and API key. Currently, we support the following models: 
- `claude-3-opus-20240229`
- `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`
- `claude-3-haiku-20240307`

Currently, only there are no supported embedding models for Anthropic. You will need to use a seperate provider (e.g. OpenAI) or the Letta embeddings endpoint (`letta-free`) for embeddings.

## Enabling Anthropic models
To enable the Anthropic provider, set your key as an environment variable:  
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..." 
```
Now, Anthropic models will be enabled with you run `letta run` or the letta service.

### Using `letta run` and `letta server` with Anthropic
To chat with an agent, run:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..." 
letta run
```
This will prompt you to select an Anthropic model.
```
? Select LLM model: (Use arrow keys)
 Â» letta-free [type=openai] [ip=https://inference.memgpt.ai]
   claude-3-opus-20240229 [type=anthropic] [ip=https://api.anthropic.com/v1]
   claude-3-sonnet-20240229 [type=anthropic] [ip=https://api.anthropic.com/v1]
   claude-3-haiku-20240307 [type=anthropic] [ip=https://api.anthropic.com/v1]
```
To run the Letta server, run:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..." 
letta server
```
To select the model used by the server, use the dropdown in the ADE or specify a `LLMConfig` object in the Python SDK.

### Using the `docker compose` server with Anthropic
The `compose.yaml` file will read your local environment variables and pass them to the Letta server running in the container. To use Anthropic with the Letta server, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable and run the server with `docker compose up`:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..." 
docker compose up 
```

## Configuring Anthropic models

When creating agents, you can specify the exactly model configurations to use, such as the model name and context window size (which can be less than the maximum size). 

To set a default `LLMConfig` to `claude-3-opus-20240229` with a context window of 200000, you can set the default config for your client: 

```python
from letta import create_client, LLMConfig

client = create_client()

# provide full config (llm config)
client.set_default_llm_config(
    LLMConfig(
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
        model_endpoint_type="anthropic",
        model_endpoint="https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
        context_window=200000 # NOTE: can be set to <= 200000
    )
)
```
