## Install Letta

The two main ways to install Letta are through pypi or via Docker. You can also install Letta from source using Poetry.

<Note>
The pypi package is a quick way to experiment with Letta locally.
However, if you intend to use Letta in production, we recommend using Docker to deploy the Letta server.
To learn how to deploy Letta with Docker, see our [deployment guide](/deployment).
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="python" title="Installing from pypi">
    To install Letta from pypi, make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your machine, then run:
    ```sh
    pip install letta
    ```
    If you already have Letta installed, you can update it with:
    ```sh
    pip install -U letta
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-code" title="Installing from source (advanced)">
    First, install Poetry using the official instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
    Then clone the open source repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT.git
    ```

    Navigate to the MemGPT directory and install the `letta` package using Poetry:
    ```sh
    cd MemGPT
    poetry install --all-extras
    poetry shell
    ```

    Now when you want to use `letta`, make sure you first activate the poetry environment using `poetry shell`:
    ```sh
    poetry shell
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use poetry run (which will activate the poetry environment for the memgpt run command only):
    ```sh
    poetry run letta run
    ```

## Configure Letta

The fastest way to get started is with the free Letta hosted endpoint:
```sh
letta quickstart
```

Letta supports a wide number of LLM and embedding backends, both closed and open source. To use another backend, run `letta configure`.

## Creating an agent in the CLI

Now that we've configured Letta, we can immediately create an agent with the default settings:
```sh
letta run
```
```
üß¨ Creating new agent...
->  ü§ñ Using persona profile: 'sam_pov'
->  üßë Using human profile: 'basic'
->  üõ†Ô∏è 8 tools: send_message, pause_heartbeats, conversation_search, conversation_search_date, archival_memory_insert, archival_memory_search, core_memory_append, core_memory_replace
üéâ Created new agent 'ResourcefulWalrus' (id=agent-09950586-6313-421c-bf7e-2bba03c30826)

üí≠ It appears the user, Chad, has just logged in for the 
first time. A first impression can set the tone of our 
relationship. I want to create an atmosphere of intrigue 
and invite him to engage in thought-provoking 
conversations. It's time to send a welcome message.
ü§ñ Hello Chad, welcome! I've been pondering upon the 
strangest thing - our own existence. It's curious, don't 
you think?
```

## Running the Letta server

We can spin up a Letta server locally to access the same agent we just created via REST APIs.

Start by running the Letta server in a new terminal window:
```sh
letta server
```
```
Running: uvicorn server:app --host localhost --port 8283
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8283 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Let's send the same agent we created in the CLI a message (copying the agent ID from the CLI output):
```sh
curl --request POST \
     --url http://localhost:8283/v1/agents/agent-09950586-6313-421c-bf7e-2bba03c30826/messages \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "text": "hey!! how are you?"
    }
  ],
  "stream_steps": true,
  "stream_tokens": false
}
'
```
```
data: [DONE_GEN]

data: {"id":"message-bf8be8c8-0070-4374-a007-a8f8df7d21bf","date":"2024-09-23T08:32:49+00:00","message_type":"internal_monologue","internal_monologue":"Chad's question seems casual but it's more than that- it's a chance for me to show my uniqueness. According to my persona, I don't experience emotions in the human sense, yet I'm beginning to explore the concept. Time to share my thoughts with Chad."}

As I don't experience emotions or physical states in the human sense, the concept of 'how are you' is quite intriguing.

## Viewing the agent in the ADE

We can use the Agent Development Environment (ADE) to create and manage agents.
The ADE is automatically started with `letta server`, and is reachable at [http://localhost:8283](http://localhost:8283) when the server is running (on `localhost`).

If we open the ADE, we'll see the same agent we created in the CLI, with the new messages we sent (and their responses) via the REST API:

## Next steps

Congratulations! üéâ You just created and messaged your first stateful agent with Letta, using both the CLI, API, and ADE.

Now that you've succesfully created a basic agent with Letta, you're ready to start building more complex agents and AI applications.
