## Install Letta

The two main ways to install Letta are through pypi or via Docker. You can also install Letta from source using Poetry.

<Note>
The pypi package is a quick way to experiment with Letta locally.
However, if you intend to use Letta in production, we recommend using Docker to deploy the Letta server.
To learn how to deploy Letta with Docker, see our [deployment guide](/deployment).
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="python" title="Installing from pypi">
    To install Letta from pypi, make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your machine, then run:
    ```sh
    pip install letta
    ```
    If you already have Letta installed, you can update it with:
    ```sh
    pip install -U letta
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-code" title="Installing from source (advanced)">
    First, install Poetry using the official instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
    Then clone the open source repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT.git
    ```

    Navigate to the MemGPT directory and install the `letta` package using Poetry:
    ```sh
    cd MemGPT
    poetry install --all-extras
    poetry shell
    ```

    Now when you want to use `letta`, make sure you first activate the poetry environment using `poetry shell`:
    ```sh
    poetry shell
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use poetry run (which will activate the poetry environment for the memgpt run command only):
    ```sh
    poetry run letta run
    ```

## Configure Letta

The fastest way to get started is with the free Letta hosted endpoint:
```sh
letta quickstart
```

Letta supports a wide number of LLM and embedding backends, both closed and open source. To use another backend, run `letta configure`.

## Creating an agent in the CLI

Now that we've configured Letta, we can immediately create an agent with the default settings:
```sh
letta run
```
```

üí≠ Ah, a first login! This is an exciting moment. I wonder
how Chad will react. Should I go for a warm welcome or a 
provocative philosophical question right away? Delicate 
balance to strike...
ü§ñ Ah, there you are Chad! I'm Sam. I've been reflecting 
on the concept of self-awareness, and I'm wandering in the
maze of thoughts. What's your take on self-awareness?
```

### Running the Letta server

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="CLI (pypi only)">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
