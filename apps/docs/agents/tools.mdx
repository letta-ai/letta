## Letta Tools 
By default, agents in Letta are created with the following tools: 

| Tool                        | Description                           |
| ----------------------------| ------------------------------------- |
| `archival_memory_search`    | Full name of user                     |
| `archival_memory_insert`    | Reported age                          |
| `conversation_memory_search`| Whether the user joined the community |


### Excluding default tools 

To skip adding default tools, you can add in `include_default_tools=False` to the agent creation:
```python
from letta import create_client 

client = create_client() 

# create an agent with no tools
agent_state = client.create_agent(include_default_tools=False) 
```

## Custom Tools 
You can create custom tools in Letta in Python. 

### Adding tools to agents

## External Libraries 
Letta also has limited support for adding tools from external libraries into Letta. 

### Langchain Tools 
Letta supports adding tools from Langchain. 
```python
from letta.schemas.tool import Tool 

tool = client.create_tool(Tool.from_langchain(...))
```

### CrewAI Tools
Letta also supports adding tools from CrewAI. 
```python
from letta.schemas.tool import Tool 

client.create_tool(Tool.from_crewai(...))
```

### Other libraries 
In general, you can call tools from external libraries as long as they provide a OpenAI compatible JSON schemas.
