## Memory 
The in-context memory of agents is represented by a `Memory` object. This object contains: 
* A set of `Block` objects representing a segment of memory, with an associated character limit and label 
* A set of memory editing tools

### `ChatMemory` 
By default, agents have a ChatMemory memory class, which is designed for a 1:1 chat between a human and agent. 

```python
from letta import create_client 
from letta.schemas.memory import ChatMemory

client = create_client() 
agent_state = client.create_agent(
    memory=ChatMemory(
        persona="I am docbot and must answer user questions.", 
        human="Name: Sarah"
    )
)
```
The ChatMemory class consists of:
* A "human" and "persona" memory sections each with a 2k character limit
* Two memory editing functions: `core_memory_replace` and `core_memory_append`

### `BasicBlockMemory` 
```python
from letta import create_client 
from letta.schemas.memory import ChatMemory

client = create_client() 

org_block = client.create_block() # TODO
persona_block = client.create_block()  # TODO

agent_state = client.create_agent(
    memory=BasicBlockMemory(
        blocks = [org_block, persona_block]
    )
)
```
