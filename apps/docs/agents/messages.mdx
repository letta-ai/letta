## Sending messages 
You can send message to agents from both the REST API and Python client: 
```python
response = client.user_message(
    agent_id=agent_state.id, 
    message="hello!", 
)
```
You can also send messages with different roles, such as `system`, `assistant`, or `user`: 
```python
response = client.send_message(
    agent_id=agent_state.id, 
    message="[SYSTEM] User has logged back in", 
    role="system" 
)
```
The `response` object contains the following attributes:
* `usage`: The usage of the agent after the message was sent (the prompt tokens, completition tokens, and total tokens) 
* `message`: A list of either `Message` or `LettaMessage` objects, generated by the agent


### Message Types 

#### `LettaMessage`
The `LettaMessage` object is a simplified version of the `Message` object. Since a `Message` can include multiple events like an inner monologue and function return, `LettaMessage` simplifies messages to have the following types: 
* `inner_monologue`: The inner monologue of the agent
* `function_call`: An agent function call 
* `function_response`: The response to an agent function call
* `system_message`: A system message
* `user_message`: A user message


#### `Message`
The `Message` object is the raw MemGPT message representation that is persisted in the database. To have the full `Message` data returns, you can set `include_full_message=True`:
```python
response = client.user_message(
    agent_id=agent_state.id, 
    message="hello!", 
    include_full_message=True
)
```
You can convert a raw `Message` object to a list of `LettaMessage` objects: 
```python
# Convert a `Message` object to a `LettaMessage` object
letta_messages = message.to_letta_message()
```
