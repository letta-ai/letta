# Project Overview: Letta Agent Framework

## Project Description
Letta is an advanced AI agent framework designed to create stateful, memory-enabled AI agents that can maintain context across long conversations and interactions.

## Key Features
- **Persistent Memory**: Agents maintain conversation history and learn from interactions
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with external APIs and services  
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Text, code, and file processing capabilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built for production deployment

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Memory System**: Custom vector store with embedding-based retrieval
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models

## Current Status
- Version: 0.4.2
- Development Stage: Beta
- Active Contributors: 12
- GitHub Stars: 3.2k

## Architecture Components
1. **Core Engine**: Agent execution and state management
2. **Memory Module**: Context storage and retrieval
3. **Tool System**: External service integrations
4. **API Layer**: REST endpoints for agent interaction

## Roadmap
- Q1 2025: Enhanced tool calling capabilities
- Q2 2025: Multi-agent orchestration
- Q3 2025: Enterprise deployment features
- Q4 2025: Advanced reasoning capabilities
