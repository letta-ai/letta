## What are Stateful Agents?

**Stateful agents are AI agents that maintain persistent memory and context across all interactions.**

Unlike traditional chatbots that treat each conversation as isolated, stateful agents:
- **Remember** - Continuously learn from interactions and build long-term memory
- **Persist** - Maintain state in a database, surviving application restarts
- **Evolve** - Update their knowledge and preferences over time
- **Exist independently** - Run as services, not ephemeral objects in your code

### Why Statefulness Matters

Traditional LLM applications are **stateless** - every interaction starts from scratch. Your application must:
- Store all conversation history in your own database
- Send the entire context with every API call
- Implement memory and personalization logic yourself
- Manually manage context window limits

**With Letta's stateful agents, all of this is handled for you.** The agent maintains its own persistent state, intelligently manages its context window, and learns from every interaction without requiring you to build a complex state management layer.

## Stateful vs Stateless APIs

The difference between stateful agents and traditional LLM APIs is fundamental:

**Traditional APIs (stateless):** No memory between requests. Your app manages everything.

**Letta (stateful):** Agents maintain their own persistent state. You only send new messages.

### Traditional Stateless API

With stateless APIs, there is no state persistence between requests. The client must send the entire conversation history with every call.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client["Client Application"]
    API["LLM API<br/>(OpenAI, Anthropic, etc)"]

    Client -->|"Send: msg1"| API
    API -->|"Return: response1"| Client
```

The client must send the full conversation history with each request:
- Request 2: `[msg1, response1, msg2]`
- Request 3: `[msg1, response1, msg2, response2, msg3]`

### Letta Stateful API

Letta maintains agent state on the server and persists it to a database. Clients only send new messages, and the server handles all state management.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client["Client Application"]
    Server["Letta Server"]
    DB[("Persistent<br/>Database")]

    Client -->|"Send: msg1"| Server
    Server <-->|"Load/Save State"| DB
    Server -->|"Return: response1"| Client
```

The client only sends new messages:
- Request 2: `[msg2]`
- Request 3: `[msg3]`

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Traditional (Stateless) | Letta (Stateful) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| **State management** | Client-side | Server-side |
| **Request format** | Send full conversation history | Send only new messages |
| **Memory** | None (ephemeral) | Persistent database |
| **Context limit** | Hard limit, then fails | Intelligent management |
| **Agent identity** | None | Each agent has unique ID |
| **Long conversations** | Expensive & brittle | Scales infinitely |
| **Personalization** | App must manage | Built-in memory blocks |
| **Multi-session** | Requires external DB | Native support |

### Code Comparison

**Stateless API (e.g., OpenAI):**
```python
# You must send the entire conversation every time
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, I'm Sarah"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi Sarah!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's my name?"},  # ← New message
]

# Send everything
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=messages  # ← Full history required
)

# You must store and manage messages yourself
messages.append(response.choices[0].message)
```

**Stateful API (Letta):**
```python
# Agent already knows context
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's my name?"}  # ← New message only
    ]
)

# Agent remembers Sarah from its memory blocks
# No need to send previous messages
```

## Agents as Services

**Letta treats agents as persistent services, not ephemeral library calls.**

In traditional frameworks, agents are objects that live in your application's memory and disappear when your app stops. In Letta, agents are **independent services** that:
- Continue to exist when your application isn't running
- Maintain state in a database
- Can be accessed from multiple applications simultaneously
- Run autonomously on the server

You interact with Letta agents through REST APIs:
```
POST /agents/{agent_id}/messages
```

This architecture enables:
- **Multi-user applications** - Each user gets their own persistent agent
- **Agent-to-agent communication** - Agents can message each other
- **Background processing** - Agents can continue working while your app is offline
- **Deployment flexibility** - Scale agents independently from your application

## Persistence by Default

In Letta, **all state is persisted automatically**:
- Agent memory (both memory blocks and archival)
- Message history
- Tool configurations
- Agent state and context

Because everything is persisted:
- Agents can be paused and resumed at any time
- You can reload agents across different machines
- State is never lost due to application restarts
- Long conversations don't degrade performance

## Self-Editing Memory

Unlike RAG systems that passively retrieve documents, **Letta agents actively manage their own memory**. Agents use built-in tools to:
- Edit their memory blocks when learning new information
- Insert facts into archival memory for long-term storage
- Search their past conversations when context is needed

This enables agents to:
- Learn user preferences over time
- Maintain consistent personality across sessions
- Build long-term relationships with users
- Continuously improve from interactions

## Agents vs Threads

Letta doesn't have the concept of **threads** or **sessions**. Instead, there are only **stateful agents** with a single perpetual message history.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart': {'rankDir': 'LR'}}}%%
flowchart LR
    subgraph Traditional["Thread-Based Agents"]
        direction TB
        llm1[LLM] --> thread1["Thread 1
        --------
        Ephemeral
        Session"]
        llm1 --> thread2["Thread 2
        --------
        Ephemeral
        Session"]
        llm1 --> thread3["Thread 3
        --------
        Ephemeral
        Session"]
    end

    Traditional ~~~ Letta

    subgraph Letta["Letta Stateful Agents"]
        direction TB
        llm2[LLM] --> agent["Single Agent
        --------
        Persistent Memory"]
        agent --> db[(PostgreSQL)]
        db -->|"Learn & Update"| agent
    end

    class thread1,thread2,thread3 session
    class agent agent
```

**Why no threads?** Letta is built on the principle that **all interactions should be part of persistent memory**, not ephemeral sessions. This enables:
- Continuous learning across all conversations
- True long-term memory and relationships
- No context loss when "starting a new thread"

For multi-user applications, we recommend **creating one agent per user**. Each agent maintains its own persistent memory about that specific user.

If you need conversation templates or starting points, use [agent templates](/guides/cloud/templates) to create new agents with pre-configured state.

## LLM OS

The **LLM Operating System** is the infrastructure layer that manages agent execution, state, and memory. This includes:
- **Agent runtime** - Manages tool execution and the reasoning loop
- **Memory layer** - Handles context window management and persistence
- **Stateful layer** - Coordinates state across database, cache, and execution

Letta's architecture is inspired by the [MemGPT research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560), which introduced these concepts.
