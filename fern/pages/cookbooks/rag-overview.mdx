If you have an existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, you can connect it to your Letta agents. While Letta provides built-in features like archival memory, you can integrate your own RAG pipeline just as you would with any LLM API. This gives you full control over your data and retrieval methods.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from external data sources before generating an answer. Instead of relying on the model's training data, a RAG system:

1. Takes a user query.
2. Searches a vector database for relevant documents.
3. Includes those documents in the LLM's context.
4. Generates an informed response based on the retrieved information.

## Choosing Your RAG Approach

Letta supports two approaches for integrating RAG, depending on how much control you want over the retrieval process.

| Aspect | Simple RAG | Agentic RAG |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Who Controls Retrieval** | Your application controls when retrieval happens and what the retrieval query is. | The agent decides when to retrieve and what query to use. |
| **Context Inclusion** | You can always include retrieval results in the context. | Retrieval happens only when the agent determines it's needed. |
| **Latency** | Lower – typically single-hop, as the agent doesn't need to do a tool call. | Higher – requires tool calls for retrieval. |
| **Client Code** | More complex, as it handles retrieval logic. | Simpler, as it just sends the user query. |
| **Customization** | You have full control via your retrieval function. | You have full control via your custom tool definition. |

Both approaches work with any vector database. Our tutorials include examples for **ChromaDB**, **MongoDB Atlas**, and **Qdrant**.
