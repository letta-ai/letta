# Colors

Below are the colors used in the app.

There are four types of colors: `default`, `content`, `dark`, and `hover`.

`Default` colors are the base colors of the app.

`Content` are used for text and icons that are on top of the `default` colors.

`Dark` is used generally for active states.

`hover` is used for hover states.

Some colors won't have a `dark` or `hover` variant.
