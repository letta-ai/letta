# Colors
Below are the colors used in the app.

There are four types of colors: `default`, `foreground`, `dark`, and `light`.

`Default` colors are the base colors of the app.

`Foreground` are used for text and icons that are on top of the `default` colors.

`Dark` is used generally for active states.

`Light` is used for hover states.

Some colors won't have a `dark` or `light` variant.

## Usage
Components will have an option called `color` that will allow you to choose from the colors below.
