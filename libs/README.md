# Libraries
Libraries are organized by a key-name in the `libs` directory.

There are 5 types of libraries:
* **sdk** - functions that allow interfacing with internal services, such as core, or web
* **ui** - UI Components
* **utils** - General utilities
* **service** - Functions that interface with some external service, such as a database or API
* **config** - Configuration files


There are also two additional directories:
* **translations** - Contains translation files
* **types** - Contains typescript types
